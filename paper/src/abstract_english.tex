There are 2 ways which realize automate item management system in the warehouse.  
The first way is using an automated rack or using robots to move a rack.
The second way is using patrol robots without any warehouse reform.  
This research focuses on the robot which is used in a second way.
We use a drone as a robot because the drone has many degrees of freedom.  
It is important that is route information and managed by software mainly.
However, It is verbose a little for patrol in the warehouse that already exists methods.
Thus, this research targeted the route control system and developed a stateless route control system.
In this system, we use QRCode to develop a stateless route control system and
